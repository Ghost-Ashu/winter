# RealTime GPS Data Logger with Goggle Maps

## Summary

Have You ever wonder! How Gobal Positioning System Tracks and Logs our Cordinates. Here  is my Project Walkthrough, where i will be building a realtime GPS Data Logger by using  Google Maps API and NodeMCU ESP8266.

## Technologies Used
Aurdino (IDE) software
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for using google Maps API

## Plan

The Latitude and Longitude on the Display of 3.5inch TFT SPI LCD(ILI9488). It'll act as interface with GPS Module and NodeMCU ESP8266 also it will display the GPS data (Latitude, longitude, date and time). I have Tried to Collect from all the Sources in Building my Project
ESP8266 Showing the Device position on the Display Screen. Using the Google Cloud platform i will be using the Static API of G- Maps. Display the geographic location of a user or device on a Google map.
--> Arduino Uno Rev3 can be used in my project, as it is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328 microcontroller. One way it could be used to collect GPS data from a GPS module, process the data to extract the desired information (e.g. latitude, longitude, altitude), and then send the data to a remote server or cloud platform over a wired or wireless connection. To use the Arduino Uno in this project, you would need to connect it to the GPS module using a serial communication interface such as UART or I2C.
-->for  Power Supply i will use an external power supply, then connect it to the barrel jack or VIN pin on the Arduino Uno board. The barrel jack can accept a voltage range of 7-12V DC. while the VIN pin can accept a regulated 5V or 6V DC. also can use power source (e.g. battery or AC adapter).
--> i already have my casing for my project. and Necessary other requirements. This is my Dream Project as this would my first GPS module Project that i have worked in years. i would be happy if u agree to approve my Project.
